# AUTOMATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH IAC USING TERRAFORM

This project is to create a basic vpc with 2 subnets on aws

## PREREQUISITE
___
- Create a user in your AWS account named **terraform** with only programmatic access to AWS and grant the user **AdministratorAccess** permission.

- Configure programmatic access from your workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys for **terraform user** and a Python SDK (boto3). You must have Python 3.6 or higher on your workstation.

- For easier authentication configuration â€“ use A**WS CLI** with *aws configure* command.

* Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state file. You can name it something like *yourname-dev-terraform-bucket*.
  ![terraform bucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7505497/146407133-4cbba08b-119f-46f3-a114-df3c13429df6.png)

* When you have configured authentication and installed boto3, make sure you can programmatically access your AWS account by running following commands in >python:

```
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```

## Create VPC
---
- In VScode create a new directory called terraform, and create a new file named **main.tf** inside the directory.
- Setup Terraform CLI following this [instruction](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli "terraform")
- Add AWS as a provider, and a resource to create a VPC in the **main.tf** file.
- The **provider** block informs Terraform that we intend to build infrastructure within AWS.
- The **resource** block will create a VPC.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"
}

# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block                     = "172.16.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support             = "true"
  enable_dns_hostnames           = "true"
  enable_classiclink             = "false"
  enable_classiclink_dns_support = "false"
}
```
- Now we download the required plugins for Terraform to work using the **terraform init** command. These plugins are used by providers and provisioners.

  ![init](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7505497/146406447-ae58b119-47c2-4969-9caf-6293dd25ed08.png)

- Next, run **terraform plan** to preview the changes that Terraform will make.
- Now apply the changes using **terraform apply**.

## Create Subnet Resources
---
We require 2 subnets, so we need to add the following block of code to **main.tf** file
```
# Create public subnets1
    resource "aws_subnet" "public1" {
    vpc_id                     = aws_vpc.main.id
    cidr_block                 = "172.16.0.0/24"
    map_public_ip_on_launch    = true
    availability_zone          = "eu-central-1a"

}

# Create public subnet2
    resource "aws_subnet" "public2" {
    vpc_id                     = aws_vpc.main.id
    cidr_block                 = "172.16.1.0/24"
    map_public_ip_on_launch    = true
    availability_zone          = "eu-central-1b"
}
```
- Now, run **terraform plan** and **terraform apply** to apply the changes to the infrastructure.

### Observation
- Hardcoded values were used for cidr_block and availability_zone arguments. This is not recommended best practise.
- Also, multiple resource blocks were used to create the public subnets. We need to create a single resource block that can dynamically create resources without specifying multiple blocks.

## Refactoring the Code
